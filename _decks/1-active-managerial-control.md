---

1a. Active mangerial control
1b. A system to create food safety procedures and implement them.

2a. Responsibility of food manager
2b. Direct food safety and train employees on safety principles, including allergy awareness.

3a. 3 steps of active managerial control
3b.
```
1. Create policy
2. Train
3. Follow up
```

4a. Policies or standard operating procedure (SOP)
4b. A set of procedures that tells staff how to control food safety hazards. Clearly explain actions that must be taken.

5a. 5 most common food safety risks
5b.
```
1. Unsafe holding temperatures
2. Inadequate cooking
3. Contaminated equipment
4. Unsafe supplier
5. Poor personal hygiene
```

6a. How to create policy
6b. Identify food safety risks. For the biggest risk, create a standard operating procedure (SOP).

7a. Questions for policy
7b. What, Why, How (Where and When), and What if.

8a. How to train employees
8b. Traning can be done on-the-job, in meetings, or online. There need to be positive reinforcement for correct behaviors and consequences for violations.

9a. On-the-job training
9b. Have experienced staff verbally teach the principle, demonstrate it, then ask the new worker to demonstrate it.

10a. Training meetings
10b. Meetings are better for teaching larger groups of people at the same time. Good when many topics or a complex policy needs to be covered.

11a. Online training
11b. Online access allows workers to learn anytime and anywhere. Good for staff working in different locations.

12a. Casual training
12b. Taking advantage of situations at work and using them as training opportunities.

13a. Positive reinforcement
13b. Reward workers when they perform tasks correctly. Rewards can be praise or material benefits.

14a. Violation consequences
14b. The consequences should be serious enough, but are proportion with the risk level of the policy.

15a. How to follow up
15b. Observe food workers to assess whether they are following SOP and applying food safety principles.

16a. Direct monitoring
16b. Personally observing what workers do. Give more accurate account of what is actually happening.

17a. Indirect monitoring
17b. Asking employees to report their own actions. Involve workers more in the process.

23a. Regulatory authority
23b. A local government organization responsible for public health, such as county health department.

24a. Violations report
24b. Take employee-reported violations seriously. Take action to correct violation and prevent future occurrences.

25a. Evaluate effectiveness
25b. Look back at safety risks to see if your policy lessened it. Adjust and evaluate as needed.

26a. Hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP)
26b. Process used to identify and prevent hazards before they occur or to catch and correct them when they do. Focus on specific steps within food preparation and handling.

27a. 7 Principles of HACCP
27b.
```
1. Perform a hazard analysis
2. Determine critical control point (CCP)
3. Set critical limits
4. Establish a monitoring system
5. Establish corrective actions
6. Establish verification procedures
7. Establish recordkeeping procedures
```

28a. Hazard analysis
28b. Identify potential food hazards associated with foods, people, equipment, and methods. Determine the likelihood and severity of each hazard.

29a. Critical control point
29b. Identify steps where hazards can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.

30a. Critical limit
30b. Measurable or observable parameter that must be achieved to control a hazard.
