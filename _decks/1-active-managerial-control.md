3a. 3 steps of active managerial control
3b.
```
1. Create policy

3. Follow up
```

4a. Policies or standard operating procedure (SOP)
4b. A set of procedures that tells staff how to control food safety hazards. Clearly explain actions that must be taken.

5a. 5 most common food safety risks
5b.
```
1. Unsafe holding temperatures
2. Inadequate cooking
3. Contaminated equipment
4. Unsafe supplier
5. Poor personal hygiene
```

6a. How to create policy
6b. Create a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the biggest identified safety risk.

7a. Questions a policy need to answer
7b. What, Why, How (Where and When), and What if.

8a. How to train employees
8b. Traning can be done on-the-job, in meetings, or online. There need to be positive reinforcement for correct behaviors and consequences for violations.

9a. On-the-job training
9b. Have experienced staff verbally teach the principle, demonstrate it, then ask the new worker to demonstrate it.

10a. Training meetings
10b. Meetings are better for teaching larger groups of people at the same time. Good when many topics or a complex policy needs to be covered.

11a. Online training
11b. Online access allows workers to learn anytime and anywhere. Good for staff working in different locations.

12a. Casual training
12b. Taking advantage of situations at work and using them as training opportunities.

13a. Positive reinforcement
13b. Reward workers when they perform tasks correctly. Rewards can be praise or material benefits.

14b. The consequences should be serious enough, but are proportion with the risk level of the policy.

15a. How to follow up
15b. Observe food workers to assess whether they are following SOP and applying food safety principles.

16a. Direct monitoring
16b. Personally observing what workers do. Give more accurate account of what is actually happening.

17a. Indirect monitoring
17b. Asking employees to report their own actions. Involve workers more in the process.

18a. Monitoring logs
18b. Written records to track progress and adjust procedures in the future. Keep workers accountable.

19a. Planned monitoring inspection
19b. Self-inspection that is announced to let the workers know so they can prepare for it. A way for workers to practice what they learned.

20a. Unplanned monitoring inspection
20b. Self-inspection to help you khnow if workers follow safety principles at all times.

2. Accompany the inspector and take notes
3. Regulatory authority should point out and correct violations during inspection
3. Make changes according to gaps in your active managerial control
```

22a. How to prepare for inspection
22b. Perform self-inspections or hire third party inspection to identify and correct food safety violations.

23a. Regulatory authority
23b. A local government organization responsible for public health, such as county health department.

24a. Worker-reported violations
24b. Take employee-reported violations seriously. Take action to correct violation and prevent future occurrences.

25a. Evaluate policy effectiveness
25b. Analysis of safety risks to see if your policy lessened it. Adjust and evaluate as needed.

26a. Hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP)
26b. Process used to identify and prevent hazards before they occur or to catch and correct them when they do. Focus on specific steps within food preparation and handling.

27a. 7 Principles of HACCP
27b.
```
1. Perform a hazard analysis
2. Determine critical control point (CCP)
3. Set critical limits
4. Establish a monitoring system
5. Establish corrective actions
6. Establish verification procedures
7. Establish recordkeeping procedures
```

28a. Hazard analysis
28b. Identify potential food hazards associated with foods, people, equipment, and methods. Determine the likelihood and severity of each hazard.

29a. Critical control point
29b. Identify steps where hazards can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.

30a. Critical limit
30b. Measurable or observable parameter that must be achieved to control a hazard.

31a. Who is the most responsible for training new staff
31b. The certified food manager (CFM) is the one who has studied and passed the exam for food safety.

32a. Corrective action
32b. A corrective action is when an unsafe practice is discovered and action is taken to stop it from happening again.

33a. What is a variance
33b. Variance is a document issued by your regulatory authority that allows a requirement to be waived or changed.

34a. When is a variance needed
34b.
