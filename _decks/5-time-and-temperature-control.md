3a. FAT TOM factors for bacteria growth
3b.
```

2. Acidity
3. Time
4. Temperature
5. Oxygen
6. Moisture
```

4a. Food factor
4b. Foods that contain proteins and carbohydrates (sugars or starches). Keep foods' natural protection intact until prepartion.

5a. Acidity factor
5b. Bacteria grows best in right levels of acidity around 4.6 to 7 pH.

6a. Time factor
6b. Amount of time bacteria needs to grow depends on other factors. TCS foods cannot stay in the temperature danger zone for more than 4 hours or it must be discarded.

7a. Temperature factor
7b. Most foodborne bacteria grow best at temperatures between 41F to 135F, or the temperature danger zone.

8a. Temperature abuse
8b. When TCS foods are left in the temperature danger zone for too long.

9a. Oxygen factor
9b. The right amount of oxygen must be present for many bacteria to multiply.

10a. Reduced oxygen packaging (ROP)
10b. Removing oxygen and seal package to slow growth of bacteria.

11a. Moisture factor
11b. Bacteria need water to multply. Measured by the water content and water activity.

12a. Water content
12b. The actual amount of water in the food.

13a. Water activity
13b. A measure of the free moisture that bacteria can use. Many types of mold and yeast can grow in water activity too low for bacteria.
