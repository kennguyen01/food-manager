---

1a. How does food becomes unsafe
1b. At any point from production to service, food can come into contact with hazards.

2a. Food hazard
2b. A food hazard is any item or substance that can make food dangerous to eat. 

3a. 3 categories of food hazards
3b.
```
1. Physical
2. Chemical
3. Biological
```

4a. Physical hazard
4b. Any item in food that can choke, gag, cut, or injure a customer.

5a. How physical hazards occur
5b. Usually accidental but can also occur naturally. Accidental includes metal from equipment, plastic packaging, and hair or fingernails from workers. Natural includes bones, seeds, and fruit pits.

6a. Preventing physical hazards
6b. Physical hazards should be removed during preparation. Unless a food item is normally expected to contain physical hazards, don't assume that customers will safely discover and remove them.

7a. Chemical hazard
7b. Any toxic or corrosive chemical that can cause illness or injury when eaten.

8a. Common chemical hazards
8b. Common restaurant chemicals for leaning, sanitizing, equipment maintenance, and pest control.

9a. Preventing chemical hazard
9b.
```
1. Don't use chemical near food
2. Avoid splashing and spraying onto food
3. Wait until food is not being prepared
4. Take movable food contact surfaces out of the area
5. Cover stationary food contact surfaces
```

10a. Safety data sheet (SDS)
10b. Manufacturer sheet contain important information about using chemical safely including safe use, handling, and risks.

11a. Storing chemical
11b. Store chemicals in cool, dry location away from areas where food is stored and prepared.

12a. Biological hazard
12b. Organisms that can make people sick when eaten. Most common cause of foodborne illness.

13a. Pathogens
13b. Microorganisms that cause disease.

14a. Preventing biological hazard
14b.
```
1. Purchase from approved suppliers
2. Inspect deliveries
3. Good personal hygiene
4. Stay home when sick
5. Clean and sanitize
6. Prevent pests
7. Maintain temperature control before, during, and after cooking
```

15a. Risk of pathongen expsure
15b. Being exposed to pathogen does not always result in illness. Risk level depends on type of pathogen.

16a. Factors that affect illness
16b.
```
1. Amount of pathogen eaten
2. Strength of person's immune system
```

17a. Highly susceptible population (HSP)
17b. People who are more vulnerable and can die from foodborne illness. This includes young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised people.

18a. Immunocompromised
18b. A person's immune system is weak due to a specific condition. Pregnant women, transplant patients, those with AIDS or cancer.

19a. HSP facilities
19b. Facilities that primarily serve a HSP. Examples include hospitals, assisted living centers (nursing homes), and day care centers.

20a. Fecal-oral route
20b. When pathogens from infected person's feces find their way into another person's mouth. Happens when workers don't wash their hands after using restroom, flies landing on food, and water contaminated by sewage.

21a. Double handwashing
21b. Workers should wash their hands in the restroom and at the handwashing sink in the food preparation area.

22a. Gastroenteritis
22b. Inflammation of the stomach and intestines, often called stomach flu. Many foodborne illness cause gastroenteritis. Symptoms include nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, headache, and fever. Workers must stay home until symptoms are gone for at least 24 hours.

23a. How bacteria spread
23b. Can come into contact with food from other surfaces. Bacteria needs nutrients, moisture, and comfortable temperature to multiply. Use time and temperature control to prevent their growth. 

24a. How viruses spread
24b. Can spread easily from infected person's feces through hands or flies. Leading cause of foodborne illness.

25a. Preventing viruses
25b.
```
1. Good personal hygiene
2. AVoid bare-hand contact with ready-to-eat food
3. Staying home when sick
4. Cleaning and sanitizing
```

26a. Parasites
26b. Organisms that live in and causes harm to the host.

27a. How food allergies happen
27b. A person's immune system reacts negatively to the proteins in a certain food.

28a. 8 major food allergens
28b.
```
1. Milk
2. Eggs
3. Fish
4. Shellfish
5. Tree nuts
6. Peanutes
7. Wheat
8. Soybeans
```

29a. Serving allergic customers
29b. Be honest with customers about potential allergens and contamination. Know the ingredients of the food you prepare, serve, and sell. Suggest safe alternatives and let the staff know when working with allergic customers.

30a. Celiac disease
30b. Should be treated like a food allergy. These customers cannot consume gluten found in grains like wheat, barley, and rye.

31a. Labeling food with allergens
31b. Packaged and wrapped food must be clearly labeled with any of the eight major allergens. Labeling does not apply to food that are given in response to a customer's order or fresh fruits and vegetables in their natural state.

32a. Allergic reaction symptoms
32b. Symptoms include tingling, rash or flushed skin, abdominal cramps, vomitting, and diarrhea.

33a. Anaphylactic shock
33b. Dangerous allergic reaction when the blood pressure drops, lungs and throat swell. Symptoms include dizziness, difficulty swallowing or breathing, cannot stay conscious, swollen lips and bluish coloring.
